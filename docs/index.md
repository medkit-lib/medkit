# Overview

`medkit` is a Python library which facilitates **extraction of features**
from various modalities of patient data, including text and audio for now
-- relational, image, genetic, and others will follow soon.

`medkit` places a strong emphasis on **non-destructive operations**,
i.e. no loss of information when passing data from a module to another,
and a flexible tracing of **data provenance**.
It enables composition of pipelines with multiple modules,
developed by the _HeKA Research Team_, contributors, and eventually yourself.

`medkit` aims at accelerating the development of a learning health system,
with a strong dedication to open-source and community development.
